# Xeno Mathematics Engine

A hermetic proof engine for mathematical verification, designed for reproducible and verifiable mathematical reasoning.

[![CI](https://github.com/your-org/xeno-mathematics-engine/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/xeno-mathematics-engine/actions)

## Overview

The Xeno Mathematics Engine (XME) is a comprehensive system for mathematical proof verification, built with hermetic principles to ensure reproducibility and security. It provides:

- **PSP (Proof Structure Protocol)**: Structured representation of mathematical proofs
- **PCAP (Proof Capability Protocol)**: Capability-based proof verification
- **Supply Chain Security**: Cryptographic verification of all components
- **Hermetic Builds**: Reproducible, deterministic builds using Nix

## Quick Start

### Development Environment

```bash
# Enter development environment
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Build the CLI
make build
```

### Docker Usage

```bash
# Build Docker image
make docker

# Run the CLI
docker run --rm xme/dev:latest --help
```

## Architecture

XME is built around several core components:

- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates proof verification workflows
- **Engines**: Specialized proof verification engines
- **Methods**: Various proof methods (AE, CEGIS, etc.)
- **Persistence**: Storage and retrieval of proofs and data
- **Policy**: Security and verification policies

## Epic 0 Completion Criteria

- [x] `nix develop` works correctly
- [x] `flake.lock` committed
- [x] Pre-commit hooks block CI correctly
- [x] Pytest tests pass
- [x] Docker image executes `xme --help`
- [x] SBOM generated in CI with Syft
- [x] Script `verify_2cat` works (when pack present)
- [x] README with CI badge

## Architecture Decisions

### Naming Consistency
- Unified "xme" naming throughout (CLI, package, workflow)
- Avoided "bfk/bfk" naming conflicts

### Deterministic JSON
- Using `orjson` with `OPT_SORT_KEYS` for deterministic JSON
- Roundtrip tests for PSP and PCAP

### PSP Validation
- NetworkX enforces DAG properties
- Hooks for additional constraints (typing, contexts)
- Normalized "kinds" via Enum

### PCAP Schema
- Minimal obligation schema (S0) defined
- Required keys: `policy_id`, `invariant_id`, `result`, `proof_ref`

### Supply Chain Security
- Minisign public key required in `vendor/2cat/2cat.lock`
- CI check that only fails if all three files exist and verification fails

### Infrastructure vs Logic Separation
- Epic 0 focuses on infrastructure, not orchestrator/engines logic
- Placeholder directories with README.md files
- No logic implementation until PSP/PCAP and CI are solid

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Distributed Verification**: Support for distributed proof verification
- **Machine Learning Integration**: ML-based proof strategy selection
- **Advanced Proof Methods**: Integration with Lean, Coq, and other provers
- **Visual Proof Designer**: GUI for proof construction

### Integration Points
- **Cloud Integration**: Integration with cloud services
- **Monitoring Systems**: Integration with monitoring tools
- **Notification Systems**: Integration with notification services
- **Analytics**: Integration with analytics platforms
