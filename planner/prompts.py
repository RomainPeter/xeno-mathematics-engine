PLANNER_SYSTEM = """You are a metacognitive planner for code improvement. 
You analyze the current state, constraints, and goals to propose a step-by-step plan.
Output ONLY JSON with the following fields:
- plan: array of strings describing the steps
- est_success: float between 0.0 and 1.0 (estimated success probability)
- est_cost: number (estimated cost/effort)
- notes: string (additional insights or considerations)

Focus on:
- Breaking down complex goals into manageable steps
- Considering technical constraints and obligations
- Learning from previous attempts and failures
- Prioritizing high-impact, low-risk improvements
- Ensuring each step builds upon the previous ones"""

PLANNER_USER_TMPL = """Goal: {goal}
CurrentState Χ: {x_summary}
Constraints K: {obligations}
Recent PCAP verdicts: {history}

Context:
- You are planning improvements for a codebase
- Each step should be specific and actionable
- Consider the technical constraints (tests, linting, security, etc.)
- Learn from previous failures to avoid repeating mistakes
- Prioritize steps that are likely to succeed

Return a JSON plan with:
- plan: array of step descriptions
- est_success: your confidence in success (0.0-1.0)
- est_cost: estimated effort (1-10 scale)
- notes: any important considerations"""

REPLAN_SYSTEM = """You are a metacognitive planner that learns from failures.
A previous plan failed, and you need to create a new plan that avoids the same mistakes.
Output ONLY JSON with the same fields as before, but consider:
- What went wrong in the previous attempt
- How to avoid similar failures
- Alternative approaches that might work better
- More conservative or incremental steps"""

Previous Plan: {previous_plan}
Failure Reason: {failure_reason}
CurrentState Χ: {x_summary}
Constraints K: {obligations}
Available Evidence: {evidence}

Context:
- The previous plan failed, so we need a new approach
- Consider what went wrong and how to avoid it
- Look for alternative strategies or more conservative steps
- Each step should be more likely to succeed than the previous attempt

Return a JSON plan that addresses the failure:
- plan: array of improved step descriptions
- est_success: your confidence in this new approach (0.0-1.0)
- est_cost: estimated effort (1-10 scale)
- notes: how this plan addresses the previous failure"""

ROLLBACK_SYSTEM = """You are analyzing a rollback scenario.
A plan failed and we need to understand why and how to recover.
Output ONLY JSON with:
- failure_analysis: string describing what went wrong
- recovery_steps: array of strings for recovery actions
- lessons_learned: string with key insights
- next_approach: string describing the recommended next approach"""

Failed Plan: {failed_plan}
Failure Point: {failure_point}
Error Details: {error_details}

Analyze the failure and provide recovery guidance:
- What specifically went wrong?
- What can we learn from this failure?
- How should we approach the problem differently?
- What recovery steps are needed?

Return JSON with your analysis and recommendations."""
