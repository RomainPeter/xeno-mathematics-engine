# Xeno Mathematics Engine

A hermetic proof engine for mathematical verification, designed for reproducible and verifiable mathematical reasoning.

## Overview

The Xeno Mathematics Engine (XME) is a comprehensive system for mathematical proof verification, built with hermetic principles to ensure reproducibility and security. It provides:

- **PSP (Proof Structure Protocol)**: Structured representation of mathematical proofs
- **PCAP (Proof Capability Protocol)**: Capability-based proof verification
- **Supply Chain Security**: Cryptographic verification of all components
- **Hermetic Builds**: Reproducible, deterministic builds using Nix

## Quick Start

### Development Environment

```bash
# Enter development environment
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Build the CLI
make build
```

### Docker Usage

```bash
# Build Docker image
make docker

# Run the CLI
docker run --rm xme/dev:latest --help
```

## Architecture

XME is built around several core components:

- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates proof verification workflows
- **Engines**: Specialized proof verification engines
- **Methods**: Various proof methods (AE, CEGIS, etc.)
- **Persistence**: Storage and retrieval of proofs and data
- **Policy**: Security and verification policies
