Title: The Proof Engine — From Documentary Chaos to an Auditable Logical Fortress
Status: Architecture-first, Spec Pack ready (v0.1.1)

Problem
- Enterprises cannot pass hostile audits with opaque AI. Vector RAG retrieves more; it does not justify. Under EU AI Act/NIST/ISO, you need guarantees, not scores.

Solution
- Lattice Memory as an Evidence Engine. Each question is a logical constraint; answers are minimal, non-redundant evidence sets with a proof journal. We replace similarity with a lattice of questions and an audit-grade journal.

What it does
- Guaranteed minimal coverage: no redundant evidence in answers.
- Explainability by construction: each output carries a proof path ≤ 10 steps.
- 24h audit readiness, offline-capable (air-gapped).
- Compliance mapping out of the box (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001).

How it works
- Ambition-to-Hostility Compiler (A2C) transforms goals into obligations, invariants, shock tests, and PCAP templates.
- Foreign primitives: lattice meet/closure; append-only merkleized proof journal; reversible compliance mapping.
- PCAP enforces that critical actions carry proofs (pre/post conditions + verifiers).

Why now
- Regulatory velocity + enterprise incidents = demand for proof-of-reasoning. We bring a spec-first approach that pays rent in guarantees, traceability, and lower audit cost.

Evidence and traction
- Spec Pack v0.1.1 delivered: obligations/invariants/operators/PCAP/tests/compliance map.
- Unified corpus of AI governance requirements; 12 Pillars mapped to obligations.
- Shock Ladder S1–S3 defined; minimal CLI harness for S1 checks included.

Go-to-market
- Dual model: Logical Safe (private client evidence) + Regulatory Starter Kits (public standards).
- Services-led first deployments (pilot within 8 weeks), then productize the Proof Engine.

Asks (for Grove)
- Design partner intros (RegTech, FinServ, Healthcare).
- Co-develop the proof journaling and homomorphism tests under real audit scenarios.
- Feedback on the PCAP and A2C method as a standard for proof-carrying AI.

How to run S1 checks locally (subset: O-1, O-2, O-4, O-5)
- Save files as provided.
- Run: python3 spec_pack/tools/run_s1.py
- Expected: “S1 suite (subset) PASS” and JSON with per-decision verifier results.

Optional next 4-hour sprint (recommend)
- Wire merkle root recomputation to journal.ndjson (add a tiny hasher).
- Add “determinism smoke test” (H-S1-02): run same query ten times, assert identical evidence_ids.
- Expand compliance_map.csv with clause-level citations (human-in-the-loop).
- Export a 90-second video storyboard from this one-pager (ready if we unpause Grove narrative track).
